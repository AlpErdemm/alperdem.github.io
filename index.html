							<h2>Highschool and Early Education</h2>

							<h2>University</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p>Computer Engineering was my passion throughout high school, driving me to prepare diligently for the university entrance exam. My efforts paid off, and I had the privilege of studying at one of the top Computer Engineering faculties in the country, Gebze Technical University. However, being at the best also meant facing the toughest challenges, so my college years were filled with intense study sessions and demanding projects. Despite the workload, I was actively involved in the game development club, tutored my peers, and played for the college tennis team.</p>

The process was filled with challenges, from game design and asset creation to music and sound effects, testing, team management, monetization, and localization. Each of these struggles provided invaluable experience and contributed to my growth as a developer. </p>
