							<p>Computer Engineering was my dream throughout my highscool years, motivating me to study for the university entrance exam. It happened, I received chance to study at one of the best Computer Engineering faculties, at Gebze Technical University. Being the best also meant that it was the hardest, thus my college years were filled with study sessions and performing projects. I was a part of the game development club, tutoring friends and a player at college tennis club.</p>
